driving tru the big horn WY
we played with cow pies on top of big horn , a scary drop made me almost pee my pants, then afterward we found a pee tree where we... peed lol

we had to stop at ranchester WY because we did overheat the break ( crazy steep hill with sharps turns)
some jerk with a trailer behind didn't know what the Yield sign means and almost got us in a accident. this moron never even stopped.
