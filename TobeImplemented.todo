Millestone:
 ☐ Equation validation
   ✔ simple implementation @done (13-03-20 19:28)
   ✔ check all side of tiles @done (13-04-01 04:22)
   ☐ checking all side of each tile for possible side equations
   ✔ add tile weight before computing @done (13-04-04 06:22)
      ☐ bug - weight is added on validation even when equation is not correct - need to keep track of old number
   ✔ check tile with disable value @done (13-06-29 20:17)
      ✔ check until we hit an '= sign @done (13-06-29 20:17)
   ✔ check if the new equation is connected to an old one. @done (13-06-29 20:17)
   ✔ reset css of chips sent back to rack  see - sendInvalidBackToRack() @done (13-06-06 18:19)

 ✔ Parser @done (13-04-08 18:50)
    ✔ rewrite  it to  handle multiple equations such at      "2+1 = 3 = 5-2" @done (13-04-08 18:50)


 ☐ Map rendering
   ✔ basic map with pattern @done (13-03-20 19:28)
   ☐ infinite map    //currently stopped
      ✔ pseudoInfinite @done (13-03-25 07:47)
      ☐ optimized intinite
   ✔ tile coloring @done (13-03-21 08:40)
     ☐ make it prettier
   ✔ Special tiles with weight @done (13-03-25 07:46)
   ✔ add homeTile @done (13-06-29 20:19)
     ☐ make it pretty 

 ☐ Network data formating
   ☐ use json format

 ☐ Scoring
   ☐ computation
   ☐ animation
      ✔ visual feedback on validation @done (13-04-01 04:23)
   ☐ fix coloring

 ☐ Tunning
   ☐ better color for background and border (need designer help)
   ☐ 
   ☐ 
Bug:
 ☐ Validation equation need more testing
 ✔ chip is offset sometime on drop @done (13-04-04 06:01)
 ☐ problem on dblclick not fired - sometime it's not removing a chip 

Tuneup:
 ☐ remove all css from js and use OOCSS
Tools:
 ☐ Texture Packer = > create a atlas(or sprite sheet) from lots of images

validation rules:
an equation is true if 
   ✔ it is make use of a previously used and disabled tile/chip. @done (13-06-06 17:23)
   ✔ if the equation contain at least one  '=' sign @done (13-06-06 17:23)
   ✔ if the left & right hand side of the equation are equal.... @done (13-06-06 17:23)
